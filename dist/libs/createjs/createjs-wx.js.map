EaselJS supports:\r\n * <ul>\r\n *      <li>Images using {{#crossLink \"Bitmap\"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>\r\n *      <li>Vector graphics using {{#crossLink \"Shape\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"Graphics\"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>\r\n *      <li>Animated bitmaps using {{#crossLink \"SpriteSheet\"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink \"Sprite\"}}{{/crossLink}}\r\n *      <li>Simple text instances using {{#crossLink \"Text\"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>\r\n *      <li>Containers that hold other DisplayObjects using {{#crossLink \"Container\"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>\r\n *      <li>Control HTML DOM elements using {{#crossLink \"DOMElement\"}}{{/crossLink}}</li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n *\r\n * All display objects can be added to the stage as children, or drawn to a canvas directly.\r\n *\r\n * <b>User Interactions</b><br />\r\n * All display objects on stage (except DOMElement) will dispatch events when interacted with using a mouse or\r\n * touch. EaselJS supports hover, press, and release events, as well as an easy-to-use drag-and-drop model. Check out\r\n * {{#crossLink \"MouseEvent\"}}{{/crossLink}} for more information.\r\n *\r\n * <h4>Simple Example</h4>\r\n * This example illustrates how to create and position a {{#crossLink \"Shape\"}}{{/crossLink}} on the {{#crossLink \"Stage\"}}{{/crossLink}}\r\n * using EaselJS' drawing API.\r\n *\r\n *\t    //Create a stage by getting a reference to the canvas\r\n *\t    stage = new createjs.Stage(\"demoCanvas\");\r\n *\t    //Create a Shape DisplayObject.\r\n *\t    circle = new createjs.Shape();\r\n *\t    circle.graphics.beginFill(\"red\").drawCircle(0, 0, 40);\r\n *\t    //Set position of Shape instance.\r\n *\t    circle.x = circle.y = 50;\r\n *\t    //Add Shape instance to stage display list.\r\n *\t    stage.addChild(circle);\r\n *\t    //Update stage will render next frame\r\n *\t    stage.update();\r\n *\r\n * <b>Simple Interaction Example</b><br>\r\n *\r\n *      displayObject.addEventListener(\"click\", handleClick);\r\n *      function handleClick(event){\r\n *          // Click happenened\r\n *      }\r\n *\r\n *      displayObject.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", handlePress);\r\n *      function handlePress(event) {\r\n *          // A mouse press happened.\r\n *          // Listen for mouse move while the mouse is down:\r\n *          event.addEventListener(\"mousemove\", handleMove);\r\n *      }\r\n *      function handleMove(event) {\r\n *          // Check out the DragAndDrop example in GitHub for more\r\n *      }\r\n *\r\n * <b>Simple Animation Example</b><br />\r\n * This example moves the shape created in the previous demo across the screen.\r\n *\r\n *\t    //Update stage will render next frame\r\n *\t    createjs.Ticker.addEventListener(\"tick\", handleTick);\r\n *\r\n *\t    function handleTick() {\r\n *          //Circle will move 10 units to the right.\r\n *\t    \tcircle.x += 10;\r\n *\t    \t//Will cause the circle to wrap back\r\n * \t    \tif (circle.x > stage.canvas.width) { circle.x = 0; }\r\n *\t    \tstage.update();\r\n *\t    }\r\n *\r\n * <h4>Other Features</h4>\r\n * EaselJS also has built in support for\r\n * <ul><li>Canvas features such as {{#crossLink \"Shadow\"}}{{/crossLink}} and CompositeOperation</li>\r\n *      <li>{{#crossLink \"Ticker\"}}{{/crossLink}}, a global heartbeat that objects can subscribe to</li>\r\n *      <li>Filters, including a provided {{#crossLink \"ColorMatrixFilter\"}}{{/crossLink}}, {{#crossLink \"AlphaMaskFilter\"}}{{/crossLink}},\r\n *      {{#crossLink \"AlphaMapFilter\"}}{{/crossLink}}, and {{#crossLink \"BlurFilter\"}}{{/crossLink}}.

Note that you can use Graphics without any dependency on the EaselJS framework by calling {{#crossLink \"Graphics/draw\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n     * directly, or it can be used with the {{#crossLink \"Shape\"}}{{/crossLink}} object to draw vector graphics within the\n     * context of an EaselJS display list.\n     *\n     * There are two approaches to working with Graphics object: calling methods on a Graphics instance (the \"Graphics API\"), or\n     * instantiating Graphics command objects and adding them to the graphics queue via {{#crossLink \"Graphics/append\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n     * The former abstracts the latter, simplifying beginning and ending paths, fills, and strokes.\n     *\n     *      var g = new createjs.Graphics();\n     *      g.setStrokeStyle(1);\n     *      g.beginStroke(\"#000000\");\n     *      g.beginFill(\"red\");\n     *      g.drawCircle(0,0,30);\n     *\n     * All drawing methods in Graphics return the Graphics instance, so they can be chained together. For example,\n     * the following line of code would generate the instructions to draw a rectangle with a red stroke and blue fill:\n     *\n     *      myGraphics.beginStroke(\"red\").beginFill(\"blue\").drawRect(20, 20, 100, 50);\n     *\n     * Each graphics API call generates a command object (see below). The last command to be created can be accessed via\n     * {{#crossLink \"Graphics/command:property\"}}{{/crossLink}}:\n     *\n     *      var fillCommand = myGraphics.beginFill(\"red\").command;\n     *      // ... later, update the fill style/color:\n     *      fillCommand.style = \"blue\";\n     *      // or change it to a bitmap fill:\n     *      fillCommand.bitmap(myImage);\n     *\n     * For more direct control of rendering, you can instantiate and append command objects to the graphics queue directly. In this case, you\n     * need to manage path creation manually, and ensure that fill/stroke is applied to a defined path:\n     *\n     *      // start a new path. Graphics.beginCmd is a reusable BeginPath instance:\n     *      myGraphics.append(createjs.Graphics.beginCmd);\n     *      // we need to define the path before applying the fill:\n     *      var circle = new createjs.Graphics.Circle(0,0,30);\n     *      myGraphics.append(circle);\n     *      // fill the path we just defined:\n     *      var fill = new createjs.Graphics.Fill(\"red\");\n     *      myGraphics.append(fill);\n     *\n     * These approaches can be used together, for example to insert a custom command:\n     *\n     *      myGraphics.beginFill(\"red\");\n     *      var customCommand = new CustomSpiralCommand(etc);\n     *      myGraphics.append(customCommand);\n     *      myGraphics.beginFill(\"blue\");\n     *      myGraphics.drawCircle(0, 0, 30);\n     *\n     * See {{#crossLink \"Graphics/append\"}}{{/crossLink}} for more info on creating custom commands.\n     *\n     * <h4>Tiny API</h4>\n     * The Graphics class also includes a \"tiny API\", which is one or two-letter methods that are shortcuts for all of the\n     * Graphics methods.

The grey shape starts on the left, but we jump to a mid-point in\n\t * the animation using {{#crossLink \"MovieClip/gotoAndPlay\"}}{{/crossLink}}.\n\t *\n\t *      var stage = new createjs.Stage(\"canvas\");\n\t *      createjs.Ticker.addEventListener(\"tick\", stage);\n\t *\n\t *      var mc = new createjs.MovieClip({loop:-1, labels:{myLabel:20}});\n\t *      stage.addChild(mc);\n\t *\n\t *      var child1 = new createjs.Shape(\n\t *          new createjs.Graphics().beginFill(\"#999999\")\n\t *              .drawCircle(30,30,30));\n\t *      var child2 = new createjs.Shape(\n\t *          new createjs.Graphics().beginFill(\"#5a9cfb\")\n\t *              .drawCircle(30,30,30));\n\t *\n\t *      mc.timeline.addTween(\n\t *          createjs.Tween.get(child1)\n\t *              .to({x:0}).to({x:60}, 50).to({x:0}, 50));\n\t *      mc.timeline.addTween(\n\t *          createjs.Tween.get(child2)\n\t *              .to({x:60}).to({x:0}, 50).to({x:60}, 50));\n\t *\n\t *      mc.gotoAndPlay(\"start\");\n\t *\n\t * It is recommended to use <code>tween.to()</code> to animate and set properties (use no duration to have it set\n\t * immediately), and the <code>tween.wait()</code> method to create delays between animations.

A sprite sheet is a series of images (usually\n\t * animation frames) combined into a larger image (or images). For example, an animation consisting of eight 100x100\n\t * images could be combined into a single 400x200 sprite sheet (4 frames across by 2 high).\n\t *\n\t * The data passed to the SpriteSheet constructor defines:\n\t * <ol>\n\t * \t<li> The source image or images to use.</li>\n\t * \t<li> The positions of individual image frames.</li>\n\t * \t<li> Sequences of frames that form named animations. Optional.</li>\n\t * \t<li> The target playback framerate. Optional.</li>\n\t * </ol>\n\t * <h3>SpriteSheet Format</h3>\n\t * SpriteSheets are an object with two required properties (`images` and `frames`), and two optional properties\n\t * (`framerate` and `animations`). This makes them easy to define in javascript code, or in JSON.\n\t *\n\t * <h4>images</h4>\n\t * An array of source images. Images can be either an HTMlimage\n\t * instance, or a uri to an image. The former is recommended to control preloading.\n\t *\n\t * \timages: [image1, \"path/to/image2.png\"],\n\t *\n\t * <h4>frames</h4>\n\t * Defines the individual frames. There are two supported formats for frame data:\n\t * When all of the frames are the same size (in a grid), use an object with `width`, `height`, `regX`, `regY`,\n\t * and `count` properties.\n\t *\n\t * <ul>\n\t *  <li>`width` & `height` are required and specify the dimensions of the frames</li>\n\t *  <li>`regX` & `regY` indicate the registration point or \"origin\" of the frames</li>\n\t *  <li>`spacing` indicate the spacing between frames</li>\n\t *  <li>`margin` specify the margin around the image(s)</li>\n\t *  <li>`count` allows you to specify the total number of frames in the spritesheet; if omitted, this will\n\t *  be calculated based on the dimensions of the source images and the frames. Frames will be assigned\n\t *  indexes based on their position in the source images (left to right, top to bottom).</li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t *\n\t *  \tframes: {width:64, height:64, count:20, regX: 32, regY:64, spacing:0, margin:0}\n\t *\n\t * If the frames are of different sizes, use an array of frame definitions. Each definition is itself an array\n\t * with 4 required and 3 optional entries, in the order:\n\t *\n\t * <ul>\n\t *  <li>The first four, `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` are required and define the frame rectangle.</li>\n\t *  <li>The fifth, `imageIndex`, specifies the index of the source image (defaults to 0)</li>\n\t *  <li>The last two, `regX` and `regY` specify the registration point of the frame</li>\n\t * </ul>\n\t *\n\t * \tframes: [\n\t * \t\t// x, y, width, height, imageIndex*, regX*, regY*\n\t * \t\t[64, 0, 96, 64],\n\t * \t\t[0, 0, 64, 64, 1, 32, 32]\n\t * \t\t// etc.\n\t * \t]\n\t *\n\t * <h4>animations</h4>\n\t * Optional. An object defining sequences of frames to play as named animations. Each property corresponds to an\n\t * animation of the same name. Each animation must specify the frames to play, and may\n\t * also include a relative playback `speed` (ex. 2 would playback at double speed, 0.5 at half), and\n\t * the name of the `next` animation to sequence to after it completes.\n\t *\n\t * There are three formats supported for defining the frames in an animation, which can be mixed and matched as appropriate:\n\t * <ol>\n\t * \t<li>for a single frame animation, you can simply specify the frame index\n\t *\n\t * \t\tanimations: {\n\t * \t\t\tsit: 7\n\t * \t\t}\n\t *\n\t * </li>\n\t * <li>\n\t *      for an animation of consecutive frames, you can use an array with two required, and two optional entries\n\t * \t\tin the order: `start`, `end`, `next`, and `speed`. This will play the frames from start to end inclusive.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tanimations: {\n\t * \t\t\t// start, end, next*, speed*\n\t * \t\t\trun: [0, 8],\n\t * \t\t\tjump: [9, 12, \"run\", 2]\n\t * \t\t}\n\t *\n\t *  </li>\n\t *  <li>\n\t *     for non-consecutive frames, you can use an object with a `frames` property defining an array of frame\n\t *     indexes to play in order. The object can also specify `next` and `speed` properties.\n\t *\n\t * \t\tanimations: {\n\t * \t\t\twalk: {\n\t * \t\t\t\tframes: [1,2,3,3,2,1]\n\t * \t\t\t},\n\t * \t\t\tshoot: {\n\t * \t\t\t\tframes: [1,4,5,6],\n\t * \t\t\t\tnext: \"walk\",\n\t * \t\t\t\tspeed: 0.5\n\t * \t\t\t}\n\t * \t\t}\n\t *\n\t *  </li>\n\t * </ol>\n\t * <strong>Note:</strong> the `speed` property was added in EaselJS 0.7.0. Earlier versions had a `frequency`\n\t * property instead, which was the inverse of `speed`. For example, a value of \"4\" would be 1/4 normal speed in\n\t * earlier versions, but is 4x normal speed in EaselJS 0.7.0+.\n\t *\n\t * <h4>framerate</h4>\n\t * Optional. Indicates the default framerate to play this spritesheet at in frames per second.

Usually has an x,y,z but can have more/less info.\n * Vertex Property: a piece of information attached to the vertex like a vector3 containing x,y,z\n * Index/Indices: used in groups of 3 to define a triangle, points to vertices by their index in an array (some render\n * \t\tmodes do not use these)\n * Card: a group of 2 triangles used to display a rectangular image\n * U/V: common names for the [0-1] texture co-ordinates on an image\n * Batch: a single call to the renderer, best done as little as possible so multiple cards are put into a single batch\n * Buffer: WebGL array data\n * Program/Shader: For every vertex we run the Vertex shader. The results are used per pixel by the Fragment shader. When\n * \t\tcombined and paired these are a shader \"program\"\n * Texture: WebGL representation of image data and associated extra information\n * Slot: A space on the GPU into which textures can be loaded for use in a batch, using \"ActiveTexture\" switches texture slot.\n */\n\n(function () {\n    \"use strict\";\n\n    /**\n     * A StageGL instance is the root level {{#crossLink \"Container\"}}{{/crossLink}} for an WebGL-optimized display list,\n     * which is used in place of the usual {{#crossLink \"Stage\"}}{{/crossLink}}. This class should behave identically to\n     * a {{#crossLink \"Stage\"}}{{/crossLink}} except for WebGL-specific functionality.\n     *\n     * Each time the {{#crossLink \"Stage/tick\"}}{{/crossLink}} method is called, the display list is rendered to the\n     * target &lt;canvas/&gt; instance, ignoring non-WebGL-compatible display objects. On devices and browsers that don't\n     * support WebGL, content will automatically be rendered to canvas 2D context instead.\n     *\n     * <h4>Limitations</h4>\n     * - {{#crossLink \"Shape\"}}{{/crossLink}}, {{#crossLink \"Shadow\"}}{{/crossLink}}, and {{#crossLink \"Text\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n     *    are not rendered when added to the display list.\n     * - To display something StageGL cannot render, {{#crossLink \"displayObject/cache\"}}{{/crossLink}} the object.\n     *    Caches can be rendered regardless of source.\n     * - Images are wrapped as a webGL \"Texture\". Each graphics card has a limit to its concurrent Textures, too many\n     * Textures will noticeably slow performance.\n     * - Each cache counts as an individual Texture. As such {{#crossLink \"SpriteSheet\"}}{{/crossLink}} and\n     * {{#crossLink \"SpriteSheetBuilder\"}}{{/crossLink}} are recommended practices to help keep texture counts low.\n     * - To use any image node (DOM Image/Canvas Element) between multiple StageGL instances it must be a\n     * {{#crossLink \"Bitmap/clone\"}}{{/crossLink}}, otherwise the GPU texture loading and tracking will get confused.\n     * - to avoid an up/down scaled render you must call {{#crossLink \"StageGL/updateViewport\"}}{{/crossLink}} if you\n     * resize your canvas after making a StageGL instance, this will properly size the WebGL context stored in memory.\n     * - Best performance in demanding scenarios will come from manual management of texture memory, but it is handled\n     * automatically by default. See {{#crossLink \"StageGL/releaseTexture\"}}{{/crossLink}} for details.\n     *\n     * <h4>Example</h4>\n     * This example creates a StageGL instance, adds a child to it, then uses the EaselJS {{#crossLink \"Ticker\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n     * to update the child and redraw the stage.\n     *\n     *      var stage = new createjs.StageGL(\"canvasElementId\");\n     *\n     *      var image = new createjs.Bitmap(\"imagePath.png\");\n     *      stage.addChild(image);\n     *\n     *      createjs.Ticker.on(\"tick\", handleTick);\n     *\n     *      function handleTick(event) {\n\t *          image.x += 10;\n\t *          stage.update();\n\t *      }\n     *\n     * <h4>Notes</h4>\n     * - StageGL is not currently included in the minified version of EaselJS.\n     * - {{#crossLink \"SpriteContainer\"}}{{/crossLink}} (the previous approach to WebGL with EaselJS) has been deprecated.\n     * - Earlier versions of WebGL support in EaselJS (SpriteStage and SpriteContainer) had hard limitations on images\n     *    per container, which have been solved.\n     *\n     * @class StageGL\n     * @extends Stage\n     * @constructor\n     * @param {HTMLCanvasElement | String | Object} canvas A canvas object that StageGL will render to, or the string id\n     *  of a canvas object in the current DOM.\n     * @param {Object} options All the option parameters in a reference object, some are not supported by some browsers.\n     * @param {Boolean} [options.preserveBuffer=false] If `true`, the canvas is NOT auto-cleared by WebGL (the spec\n     *  discourages setting this to `true`).

If not then it will default to \"new\".\n\t * - If options.useGL is a StageGL instance it will not create one but use the one provided.\n\t * - If options.useGL is undefined a Context 2D cache will be performed.\n\t *\n\t * This means you can use any combination of StageGL and 2D with either, neither, or both the stage and cache being\n\t * WebGL. Using \"new\" with a StageGL display list is highly unrecommended, but still an option. It should be avoided\n\t * due to negative performance reasons and the Image loading limitation noted in the class complications above.\n\t *\n\t * When \"options.useGL\" is set to the parent stage of the target and WebGL, performance is increased by using\n\t * \"RenderTextures\" instead of canvas elements. These are internal Textures on the graphics card stored in the GPU.\n\t * Because they are no longer canvases you cannot perform operations you could with a regular canvas. The benefit\n\t * is that this avoids the slowdown of copying the texture back and forth from the GPU to a Canvas element.\n\t * This means \"stage\" is the recommended option when available.\n\t *\n\t * A StageGL cache does not infer the ability to draw objects a StageGL cannot currently draw, i.e. do not use a\n\t * WebGL context cache when caching a Shape, Text, etc.\n\t * <h4>WebGL cache with a 2D context</h4>\n\t *\n\t *     var stage = new createjs.Stage();\n\t *     var bmp = new createjs.Bitmap(src);\n\t *     bmp.cache(0, 0, bmp.width, bmp.height, 1, {gl: \"new\"});          // no StageGL to use, so make one\n\t *\n\t *     var shape = new createjs.Shape();\n\t *     shape.graphics.clear().fill(\"red\").drawRect(0,0,20,20);\n\t *     shape.cache(0, 0, 20, 20, 1);                             // cannot use WebGL cache\n\t *\n\t * <h4>WebGL cache with a WebGL context</h4>\n\t *\n\t *     var stageGL = new createjs.StageGL();\n\t *     var bmp = new createjs.Bitmap(src);\n\t *     bmp.cache(0, 0, bmp.width, bmp.height, 1, {gl: \"stage\"});       // use our StageGL to cache\n\t *\n\t *     var shape = new createjs.Shape();\n\t *     shape.graphics.clear().fill(\"red\").drawRect(0,0,20,20);\n\t *     shape.cache(0, 0, 20, 20, 1);                             // cannot use WebGL cache\n\t *\n\t * You may wish to create your own StageGL instance to control factors like clear color, transparency, AA, and\n\t * others.
